# Example React App with Sentry Integration

This is an example integration of Sentry with React.

## Setup

- Clone the project
- **Replace the DSN here with your own Sentry DSN (sign up at http://sentry.io if you don't have an account and DSN)**. If you're unsure what a DSN is, or where to find it, [here's some info](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/)
- `cd` into the project directory and run `npm start`
- On the page that loads, click the button to trigger an error.
